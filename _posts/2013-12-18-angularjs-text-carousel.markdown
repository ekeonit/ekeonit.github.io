<p>A primitive, non-interactive text carousel directive for AngularJS (<a target="_blank" href="https://gist.github.com/ekeonit/8024016">gist</a>).  It requires jQuery for the fading animations, but you could use pure css 3 transitions to remove that dependency.</p>

<p>
A nice extension would involve seeding the values with an array of strings on the scope.  The interface could be made to support either use case seamlessly.</p>
