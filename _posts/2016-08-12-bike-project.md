I bike a lot (to get places) and I love it and wouldn't trade it for anything, but after a while you start noticing these disadvantages compared to other modes, like cars, motorbikes, scooters, etc.  What I'd like to figure out is how to affordably upgrade my bike so that it's not such a pain in the ass.

Here's the bike:

Nothing special.  Bought it used from the bike shop at UBC.  Its big frame caught my wife's eye one day, and I picked it up for a couple hundred bucks.  So far so good.

But the annoyances don't really have anything to do with the bike itself, so on to it:

# Security

A lot of this has to do with the never-ending vulnerability of the bike and anything attached to it.  What I want is the same security that car and motorbike drivers have: pretty much just park and walk away.  Compare to my routine when biking: find a bike rack or something to lock to; get out my lock and struggle to secure my frame and front tire and maybe helmet; take off my panniers, and, sometimes also lights.  After all that, I'm now stuck hauling around my panniers, and despite all this effort my bike still might be stolen or preyed upon.

My dream is to just park my bike and head off, without taking any more risk than other drivers do everyday.

# Listening

Less important than security, I wish that I could enjoy audio like I do in the car: without having to put buds in, and able to easily play/pause, change volume, etc.  Actually I'll only wear a bud in one ear, less I become like one of bikers in Vancouver that <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/life/a_fine_whine/2012/11/cycling_with_headphones_is_incredibly_dumb_why_does_anyone_do_it.html">I think so poorly</a> of for unsafe and disorderly behaviour.  Anyway, after sorting out the security issues, I'll look into what options there are for safe listening on the bike.
