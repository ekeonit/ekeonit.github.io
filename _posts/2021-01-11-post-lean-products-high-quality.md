It seems like technical and product quality of software has been, intentionally or not, significantly sacrificed in the pursuit of lean products, MVPs, etc.

I'm not going to argue that Quality should be sacred.  I'm not going to argue that Quality is not one of the levers that can be adjusted to achieve desired outcomes.

I'm just saying that Quality isn't even in the room anymore.

But let's say that some hypothetical software company demands both Agile or Lean development and high technical and product quality.  The catch is that programmers, software developers, engineers - they don't *know how* to write high quality software, or if they do, they wouldn't be able to remotely come close to providing useful estimations of how long it will take to do it.  Of course, this situation is not going to be acceptable to most software startups.

I wonder if there's been any research to determine how many startups failed due in large part to low software quality.

It's an almost impossible situation at early startups: a massive amount of work and a limited amount of time, money and people.  Engineers have few if any other options but to sacrifice Quality.  And usually, they do this in silence.  It's not easy to admit that you're considering or have already built something shoddy.  The default assumption is that Quality will be high even though it's rarely said or discussed.

I've been working on a side project recently and I observed that I was emulating the same behaviour: to build as fast as possible, to reach an MVP as fast as possible, with little to no concern for technical or product quality.  Blinders up!  Plow forward.  I know the reasons why we work this way.  I know the benefits of getting something functional in front of users as soon as possible.  But I'm starting to think, taken all together, that this is not an approach that is successful most of the time.

Aside from all that, it feels less fulfilling.  At least for me.

So at work, let's talk more about Quality, let's at least get it back into the room.  And for side projects, experiment with building software of a very high quality.
