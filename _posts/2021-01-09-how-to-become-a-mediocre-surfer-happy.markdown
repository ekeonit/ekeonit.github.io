After hundreds of hours trying to surf, I'm proud to say I've become a mediocre and happy surfer.  For most of the time before this, I've been an unhappy, slightly more mediocre surfer.  In the beginning, I was a terrible surfer and usually unhappy about it.

This milestone really has little to do with any special advancement in my skills or accomplishment of a particular trick or goal.  Instead, it's a realization that I can enjoy the hell out of my below average surfing abilities.

Sadly, it's taken a long time to arrive at this awareness and I wondered if I could share what I've learned and realized, to make someone else's journey to happy mediocrity a little bit faster.

Every time I am out trying to surf, I see new surfers, in their early years, getting repeatedly throttled by the ocean.  And I can see that they are really trying to have a good time, but without fail they will walk out of the water dejected.

When I see these new surfers, I think about going over to them and sharing what I've learned about enjoying being a terrible surfer so that maybe, just maybe, they'll walk out of the water happy and stoked and still terrible.  I am certain I now have the perspective and knowledge to do this, but it's just not in my nature to approach strangers in the ocean wearing a wet-suit and offer to save them from themselves.

So here we are.  A guide for the rest of us, beginning with a promise: you can learn to love sucking at surfing as much as I do.

Let's get to work.
